# General

Of course, everyone's voice is different, and everyone's musical style is different. 
Also, every scream can be done in many ways with lots of nuance. 
In the videos I took data from, the vocalists actively demonstrate a wide variety of realizations of each technique,
and I just took one of the many for my analysis.

# Will Ramos
- Tunnel: uses the epiglottis a lot, according to the spectroscopy
- Mid: heavily voiced, while Mark and I have a dry voiceless mid

# Mark Garrett
- Mark doesn't really do pig squeals

# Russell Emerine
- Found it difficult to maintain the same mouth shape for high screams with and without distortion
- Screams (at least these ones, which have little to no voice) are much quieter than sung notes
